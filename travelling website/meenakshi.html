            <h2>Meenakshi Amman Temple</h2>
            <p>The Meenakshi Temple, also known as Meenakshi Amman or Minakshi-Sundareshwara Temple, is a historic Hindu temple located on the southern bank of the Vaigai River in the temple city of Madurai, 1  Tamil Nadu, India. It is dedicated to Meenakshi, a form of Parvati, and her consort, Sundareswarar, 2  a form of Shiva.   
                
                The temple has deep historical roots, with mentions dating back to the 6th century CE. However, the present structure is largely a result of rebuilding efforts after the 14th century CE, with significant contributions from the Vijayanagara Empire rulers and the Nayak dynasty in the 16th and 17th centuries.
                
                The temple complex is renowned for its intricate Dravidian architecture, featuring 14 towering gopurams (gateway towers) adorned with vibrant sculptures. The inner sanctum houses the deities of Meenakshi and Sundareswarar, while the complex also includes numerous shrines, halls, and mandapas, each with unique architectural and historical significance.
                
                The temple is a major pilgrimage site for Hindus, particularly devotees of Shiva and Parvati. It is also celebrated for its annual Chithirai festival, a grand 10-day event that attracts millions of devotees and showcases the rich cultural heritage of Tamil Nadu..</p>
